Adams Fall is writer Sean Desmond's first novel. It recounts the events which occur to a college student in his senior year at Harvard University. In the midst of completing his thesis and applying for a study abroad program, the narrator copes with his stresses by resorting to alcohol and drugs.
Adams House, a real House at Harvard, features prominently in the novel; the author is himself a Harvard graduate.
The novel was the (loose) basis for the 2002 film Abandon starring Katie Holmes.
