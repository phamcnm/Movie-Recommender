== Plot ==
The life of Yale law student Sherman (Michael Shulman, Party of Five) takes an unexpected turn when he decides to follow his girlfriend’s (Lacey Chabert, Not Another Teen Movie) advice and take more chances in life. She meant their relationship. But Sherman’s new spontaneity lands him in the car seat next to Palmer (James LeGros, Sleeper Cell, Ally McBeal), a washed-up, cheerfully eccentric former Olympic athlete.
Dumped and cut off from his mother’s funds, Sherman has to travel with Palmer to Southern California for an important job opportunity.
