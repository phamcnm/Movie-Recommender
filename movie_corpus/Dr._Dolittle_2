Dr. Dolittle 2 (also known as Doctor Dolittle 2) is a 2001 American comedy film and a sequel to the 1998 film Dr. Dolittle. It was written by Larry Levin, one of the co-writers of Dr. Dolittle, and directed by Steve Carr. The film stars Eddie Murphy, Kristen Wilson, Jeffrey Jones, and Kevin Pollak.
It tells the story of Dr. Dolittle as tries to help the animals protect their forest from unscrupulous human developers. He decides to populate the forest with a species of animal that the law protects, and enlists the help of Ava (voiced by Lisa Kudrow), a lone Pacific western bear living in the condemned forest. To provide her with a mate, Dolittle turns to Archie (voiced by Steve Zahn), a wise-cracking circus-performing bear.
This is the last Dr. Dolittle film to feature Eddie Murphy in the lead role, before Kyla Pratt became the lead role in future films, starting with Dr. Dolittle 3 in 2006. It is also the last Dr. Dolittle film to feature Raven-Symoné as Charisse Dolittle.


== Plot ==
Three years after the events of the first film, veterinarian Dr. John Dolittle's (Eddie Murphy) ability to talk to animals has made him famous, and he travels the world performing his skills. In one instance, Dolittle tries to warn Steve Irwin that an alligator (Kevin Pollak) will attack him in the arm.
Returning home from France, he gives his daughter Maya (Kyla Pratt) a chameleon named Pepito (Jacob Vargas), and punishes his other daughter Charisse (Raven-Symoné) for doing poorly in school, confiscating her phone for a week. Charisse's boyfriend Eric (Lil Zane) joins the family for Charisse's 16th birthday party, where an opossum (Isaac Hayes) and a raccoon named Joey (Michael Rapaport), tell John that their boss, the Godbeaver (Godfather of the rodent mafia), wants to see him. John meets the Godbeaver (Richard C. Sarafian) and agrees to save the forest from being cut down by mating an endangered female Pacific western bear with a male.
At a circus, John persuades Archie (Steve Zahn), the sole surviving Pacific western male, to accompany him to the forest and become a real bear. John takes his family on a month-long vacation to the forest, where he makes a deal with the sole surviving Pacific western female bear named Ava (Lisa Kudrow), who is involved with a male Kodiak bear named Sonny (Mike Epps). She agrees not to make any decisions for a month after John promises to turn Archie into a bear she will love.
Struggling to train Archie, who is used to the pampered lifestyle, John hires the local forest creatures to chaperone Charisse and Eric, and neglects his wife Lisa (Kristen Wilson). After assuring Archie that he will find a way to win Ava's heart, John attempts to win Lisa back by dancing in their cabin, with every animal in the forest watching, but Lucky the dog (Norm Macdonald) accidentally ruins it. Archie attempts to get Ava's attention by imitating John singing, but falls from a tree branch. Humiliated, he refuses to leave his new-found cave, but becomes frustrated with John's insults and knocks him into a muddy hole, finally listening to his "inner bear". Later, Archie spends the day with Ava, whose relationship with Sonny is declining. Lucky tries to woo a female wolf, successfully urinating around her territory, but is interrupted by one of her packmates before she agrees to go out with him. Meanwhile, Sonny forces Ava to leave Archie.
Logging magnate Joe Potter (Jeffrey Jones) and his lawyer Jack Riley (Kevin Pollak) attempt to make a deal with John, until Archie tells John he has prepared his "big finish" to win Ava and goes after a beehive at the edge of a tall hill, ignoring John's warnings and the attacking bees who also attack a nearby Riley. He manages to get the hive, finally winning Ava's heart and the respect of the other forest animals. Ava then dumps Sonny, finally having had enough of his rudeness to Archie.
In a game of hide and seek with Ava, Archie is shot by a tranquilizer dart from Riley. John learns that Archie had somewhat destroyed the back of a restaurant. After getting information from a weasel (Andy Dick), John visits Archie in jail, telling him that he may be too dangerous to go free and will be sold to a Mexican circus, ending John's chance of saving the forest. John realizes that Charisse has developed her father's gift of talking to animals, reigniting his determination to save the forest. He rallies the animals of the forest not to give up without a fight and free Archie. Charisse, Eric, and Maya rebel against the loggers as the wolves appear. Word of Archie's predicament spreads, leading animals around the world to go on strike like cows not giving milk, chickens throwing eggs at farmers, and dogs not listening to their owners.
Mr. Potter and Riley are attacked by the animals. While Riley takes the brunt from the birds, wolves, and bees, Mr. Potter is cornered by Ava and Joey, forcing him to negotiate with John and the animals. When the animals refuse Mr. Potter's new deal, the strike continues to grow with several animal pros, including race horses and Shamu, getting in on the act. Finally, a deal is made and the Dolittles and animals accept, freeing Archie and saving the entire forest outside San Francisco.
John and Charisse become closer, talking with and helping animals together, while Archie and Ava mate and have two cubs (Frankie Muniz and Mandy Moore).
During the credits, Pepito socializes with the plastic dinosaurs, the Drunk Monkey interacts with Pepito, and the race horses are still not running causing their riders to ride each other.
