Stuart Little 2 is a 2002 American live action/computer-animated family comedy film directed by Rob Minkoff and starring Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie, and Jonathan Lipnicki, and the voices of Michael J. Fox as Stuart Little and Nathan Lane as Snowbell the cat. Although a sequel to the 1999 film Stuart Little, the plot bears more resemblance to the original novel by E.B. White, in which Stuart and Snowbell must save a canary named Margalo (voiced by Melanie Griffith) from an evil falcon (voiced by James Woods).
The film was released to theaters on July 19, 2002 by Columbia Pictures, and grossed $170 million against a $120 million budget. It was followed by a third film, a direct-to-video sequel titled Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild in 2005. However, unlike these previous two films, which were hybrids of live action and animation, the third film was entirely animated.


== Plot ==
Three years after his adoption, Stuart Little questions his abilities following a disastrous soccer match alongside his adoptive older brother George. Stuart's relationship with George is strained further after Stuart accidentally crashes a model airplane he and George were creating in the house. Stuart's adoptive father, Frederick, tries to encourage him, telling him that "every cloud has a silver lining."
Later, Margalo, an apparently injured canary, falls into Stuart's roadster as he is driving home from school. Stuart invites Margalo to stay with his family for a while. However, Margalo is secretly assisting her master, a greedy falcon, to steal valuables from households. Orphaned as a fledgling, Margalo grows reluctant to steal from the Littles and becomes close friends with Stuart. The Falcon threatens to kill Stuart unless Margalo steals Eleanor's wedding ring. Concerned for Stuart's safety, Margalo complies.
When the Littles discover that Eleanor's ring is missing, they think it has fallen down their kitchen sink. Stuart offers to be lowered down the drain on a string to get it, but the string breaks, causing him to fall. Margalo saves Stuart and leaves the Littles' house that night in order to protect him. The next day, Stuart assumes Margalo has been kidnapped by the Falcon and decides to rescue her with the help of the Littles' cat Snowbell. Before he leaves, Stuart asks George to lie about his whereabouts to his parents.
Following advice from Snowbell's alley cat friend Monty, Stuart and Snowbell discover that the Falcon resides in the Pishkin Building. There, Stuart confronts the Falcon. Margalo assures Stuart that although she was following the Falcon's orders, she is still his friend. Stuart begs Margalo to come home with him, but the Falcon refuses to let Margalo quit her job. Despite Stuart's attempt to attack the Falcon, he drops Stuart over the side of the building, although Stuart survives by landing in a passing garbage truck. The Falcon captures Margalo and imprisons her in a paint can as punishment. However, Snowbell, who has become worried about Stuart, makes his way to the building and finds Margalo while the Falcon is absent.
At the same time, Stuart awakens on a garbage barge that was leaving New York and considers giving up until he finds his and George's broken yet still-functioning model airplane on the barge. Cobbling it together using various pieces of trash, Stuart repairs the plane and escapes back to New York City to rescue Margalo. Meanwhile, the Littles discover George has lied (he told them Stuart was sleeping at his friend Will's house for a school play) because Stuart is nowhere to be found.
Meanwhile, Snowbell frees Margalo from the paint can, but the Falcon arrives and attacks him. As he tries to push Snowbell off the building, the Falcon is intercepted by Margalo, who threatens to toss the ring off the roof if he kills Snowbell. Before the Falcon could reclaim the ring from Margalo, Stuart swoops in on his plane to catch her. The Falcon catches up to the two in Central Park, while the Littles and Snowbell follow them. Stuart succeeds in blinding the Falcon by reflecting sunlight off his mother's ring before jumping from the plane, which crashes into Falcon, clipping his wings and causing him to fall in the trash can below, where Monty presumably eats him. Margalo safely brings Stuart back to the Littles and returns Eleanor's ring while Snowbell also reunites with them. Sometime later, Margalo says goodbye to the Littles and leaves to migrate south for the winter.
