== Reception ==
Howard Thompson, in a review for The New York Times wrote: "Now, in all fairness to a frankly light-headed vehicle that dies on its feet, Mr. Lewis' latest gets off to a fresh and really funny beginning." However, after the first half-hour, "the remainder of the picture, with everyone else firmly relegated to the background, [it] has Mr. Lewis shuffling and stumbling in full view, as if he and the movie were merely improvising."In 1998, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top 100.On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 100% rating based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 7.25/10.
