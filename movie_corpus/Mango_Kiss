It is based on the play Bermuda Triangles, written by Sarah Brown.

== Reviews ==
With a sly sense of humor and plenty of sex, Mango Kiss is a rollicking, sugar-coated spree through the wacky world of women-whipping-women. And, believe it or not, I'll kiss and tell you that at its heart Mango Kiss is an ode to old-fashioned romance.
