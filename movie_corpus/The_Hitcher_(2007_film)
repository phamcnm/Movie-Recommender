== Plot ==
College students Jim (Zachary Knighton) and Grace (Sophia Bush) are driving across New Mexico to meet her friends for spring break. One night, they almost hit a hitchhiker (Sean Bean) who is standing in the middle of the road; Jim swerves and the car spins out of control to a stop. As the man approaches, Grace insists that someone else will stop to help him, and they take off.
Later that night at a gas station, Jim meets the hitchhiker who introduces himself as John Ryder and he asks for a ride. Reluctantly, Jim agrees. While on the road, he becomes violent and attacks them, holding a knife to Grace's eye. He tells Jim the only way to save them both is to say "I want to die". Jim hits the brakes, causing John to hit his head on the windshield, and then Jim kicks him out of the car. Grace tells Jim she wants to go home but he persuades her to continue with their trip.
The following day, they spot John in a family's car. Jim and Grace try to warn the family but crash their car. They are forced to continue on foot and eventually find the family's car on the side of the road; both the children and mother are already dead, with the father badly wounded. They take the car and stop at a nearby cafe for them, but the man dies. 
Suspected of having committed the murders, Jim and Grace are arrested and brought to the police station. John arrives shortly after and kills everyone at the station, while Jim and Grace flee. Lieutenant Esteridge pursues the couple, but John shows up and helps Jim and Grace escape the police, single-handedly taking out all of the police cruisers and a helicopter.
Grace and Jim check in at a motel. Grace falls asleep but is later woken by John, who tries to rape her. She manages to fight him off and hides in the bathroom. John suddenly disappears so Grace leaves the motel to look for Jim, and finds him chained at the wrists and ankles between a truck and a trailer. Grace approaches the truck, which is being revved up by John, and demands that he stops. The police arrive and tell her to drop her gun, as John drives forward and splits Jim in half, killing him. John is apprehended by the police.
The next morning, Esteridge tells Grace that the real John Ryder is missing and they do not know the true identity of the hitchhiker. He informs her the hitchhiker will be transported across the state to another prison. During the journey, the hitchhiker breaks free from his restraints and kills everyone in the van, causing the vehicle to crash, with Esteridge and Grace crashing close behind them. The hitchhiker shoots a pool of gasoline, igniting it, as Grace manages to escape from the car. Meanwhile, the hitchhiker shoots and kills Esteridge who is trapped in the car. Grace shoots the hitchhiker in the back and then in the chest. The hitchhiker asks her, "Feels good, doesn't it?" to which she replies "I don't feel a thing" before she shoots him in the head.
