The series was produced by Decode Entertainment with the participation of Family Channel and in association with Channel Five Broadcasting Limited for the first two seasons. The show follows the adventures of Francine "Franny" Fantootsie (a portmanteau of "fantasy" and "tootsie") as she tries on a new shoe and travels to different places in the world. It first premiered on Family Channel in Canada on July 8, 2003 and ran through April 10, 2010. The series aired on Light TV.


== Summary ==
5-year-old Franny visits with her Grandpa every day at his shoe repair shop in Vancouver. They like to talk about matters until a customer comes. The customer presents shoes needing to be repaired to Grandpa, and he gives the pair to Franny to place inside the shoe repair box. Franny tries on the footwear and they take her to a magical place such as a Native American powwow in Wyoming, a sunny beach in Jamaica, or a high mountain in China. At the end of each episode, after Franny solves the problem in a magical place, she receives a treasure and adds it to her treasure box and solves her own problem.
The series is designed to teach children about the joys of exploring for the first time. It has been praised by critics in the United States and Canada and has been honored as an Outstanding Product of 2007 by iParenting Media Awards.
