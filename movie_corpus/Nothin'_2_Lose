== Plot ==
Kwame Gatmon is a young man with a promising career as a music producer and a beautiful girlfriend, Yasmine. But Yasmine is tired of watching all of her girlfriends get married while she stands on the sidelines, and one day she gives Kwame an ultimatum—either he marries her in 30 days, or the relationship is over. Kwame is not sure what to do; while he loves Yasmine, he also likes his freedom.
But the worst part of it all is, he has not been getting much positive feedback from all of his friends who are married men. He has been unwillingly placed at a major crossroad in his life, and now he has to choose between living the carefree lifestyle he has become accustomed to, or keeping the one true love of his life.
