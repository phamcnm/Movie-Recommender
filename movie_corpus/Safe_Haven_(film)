== Plot ==
Erin, terrified, flees her house in Boston, having been in the possession of a bloody knife. After taking shelter with a neighbor, she goes to the bus station to flee town. Her hair is now cropped and bleached and she stops in the small town of Southport, North Carolina. 
She introduces herself as Katie at the general store. After getting a job as a waitress, and renting a small house on the edge of town, she befriends her neighbor, Jo. She meets Alex Wheatley who operates the local general store, a widowed father of two young children, Josh, who has a strained relationship with him, and Lexie. Alex soon gives Katie a bicycle so she will not have to walk long distances across town. Initially she over-reacts negatively to the kind gesture, not wishing to "owe anything to anyone".
It is not long before Katie and Alex start a relationship, and she becomes a mother figure to Josh and Lexie. Meanwhile, Kevin Tierney, a Boston police detective, prepares wanted posters for a woman named "Erin" which describes that she is wanted for first-degree murder. Alex sees the wanted poster in the police station, noticing the picture bears a striking resemblance to Katie. He confronts her, causing a huge fight - she attempts to explain that she was young and stupid and married a man who only hurt her - but they break up, and Katie moves out.
As Katie is about to leave town Alex intercepts her, saying he has fallen in love with her, begging her not to leave and promising to keep her safe. Katie reluctantly returns his love, and decides to stay in Southport (though still apprehensive of bringing danger upon Alex's family). She tells him that she fled there to escape her abusive and alcoholic cop husband. They got in a big fight and that she stabbed him in self-defense before she fled south in a panic, in hopes of finally escaping him and his abuse.
Meanwhile, Kevin is suspended for creating the false wanted posters - for crimes that were not committed - whereupon it is revealed that he is Katie's (Erin's) abusive, alcoholic husband, still very much alive and well. Enraged, he breaks into Katie's former neighbor's home in Boston and gets the phone number to the restaurant where Katie works. Arriving in time for the town's Fourth of July parade, a severely intoxicated Kevin sees Katie kissing Alex, which enrages him. That evening, Katie has a dream that she is standing on the docks watching the fireworks when Jo comes up and tells Katie that "he" is here. Katie wakes up in the convenience store next to a sleeping Lexie when Kevin suddenly appears, confronts her, demanding that she go back with him. She refuses and tells him to leave. Kevin pulls a gun and pours gasoline all over the store, with the intent to burn it down.
Katie buys time by faking sympathy for him and agreeing to return home with him. When he lets his guard down, she pushes him into the water. A firework spark lands on the gasoline, igniting a fire that engulfs the store. Alex sees the burning store, quickly crosses the harbor by boat, and saves Lexie. Meanwhile, as Katie tries to fight off Kevin, the gun goes off and kills Kevin.
After the fire, Alex recovers several letters written by his late wife Carly before she died. They were prepared ahead of time for memorable events such as Josh's eighteenth birthday and Lexie's wedding day. Alex gives Katie a letter with the words "To Her" on the envelope. It explains that Alex must be in love to have given her the letter and she hopes that she feels the same, wishing that she could be there with them. Enclosed with the letter is a photo of Alex's late wife. Katie realizes that her neighbor "Jo" was the ghost of Carly watching over them.

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+.Richard Roeper called the film "Bat. Bleep. Crazy." and asks if the filmmakers or a key character is out of her mind.
