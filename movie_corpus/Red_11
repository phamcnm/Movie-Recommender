== Premise ==
Set in a dark, twisted world of legal drug research where college kids become lab rats to make quick money, the film focuses on Rob (Roby Attal) who is trying to buy his way out of a huge debt of $7,000. Given the designation of Red 11, things get surreal when he's not sure if the hospital is really trying to kill him, or if it's side effects from the experimental drugs. Red 11 is based on director/writer Robert Rodriguez's experiences in a medical research facility to finance his first feature El Mariachi.
