Alex & Emma is a 2003 American romantic comedy film directed by Rob Reiner and starring Kate Hudson and Luke Wilson. Written by Jeremy Leven, the film is about a writer who must publish a novel in thirty days or face the wrath of loan sharks.


== Plot ==
Alex Sheldon (Luke Wilson) finds himself in a tricky situation. With writer's block and heavily in debt: he is broke, and must repay US$100,000 to the Cuban mafia. He is given a 30-day ultimatum to pay the money he owes or they will kill him. And the only solution to this big problem is to finish his novel. Or rather, to start it, since he has not written one single line. But he has an idea for the story: A comedy about "the powerlessness of being in love, how love devours the insides of a person like a deadly virus".
He decides to hire the services of Emma Dinsmore (Kate Hudson), a stubborn stenographer, for her help to write the novel. The novel tells the story of Adam Shipley (Luke Wilson), a writer who has been hired to tutor the children of an attractive French woman (Sophie Marceau). She is going through bad economic times, and Adam falls in love, despite the failed temptations of the au pair. 
As Alex dictates his novel to Emma, the movie cuts away to scenes from the novel, where Adam (Wilson) interacts with a series of nannies (all played by Hudson), and falls for the last one. As they work together, Emma begins to question his ideas. It starts to affect his life as well as his work. They soon fall for each other.
Alas, after finishing the book, Emma discovers that the French woman in the story was based on a real person, a former girlfriend of Alex. His ex just broke up with her latest boyfriend, sitting with him in a caf√© she invites him to a charity ball. Alex soon realizes that the person he really wants to be with is Emma. 
After the book is done and handed in to his publisher he pays off his debt. Then, after much prodding, he convinces Emma to rewrite the ending of the book in which Alex has changed. He shows her he wants her to be an important part of his life. Emma loves it, Alex professes his love to her, and she kisses him..

== Production ==
Developed under the working title, Loosely Based on a True Love Story, the film is loosely based on a true love story of author Fyodor Dostoevsky, who dictated his 1866 novel, The Gambler in 30 days in order to pay off a gambling debt and, in the process, fell in love with his young stenographer.
The film was modeled after the 1964 Audrey Hepburn film, Paris When It Sizzles.


== Reception ==
The film was widely panned by critics, with Rotten Tomatoes giving it an 11% positive rating by calling it "a dull and unfunny comedy where the leads fail to generate any sparks." Alex & Emma was a flop, grossing just over US$15 million at the box office.
