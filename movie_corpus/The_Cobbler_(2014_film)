== Plot ==
In the Lower East Side NYC in 1903, a group of Jewish men gather in a cobbler's shop to discuss a neighborhood problem. Gergerman has been threatening their businesses, harassing them and their families. Handing a pair of Gergerman's shoes to the cobbler, Pinchas Simkin, he takes them to the shop basement and uses a special stitching machine on the shoes. His young son Herschel enters, and he explains how important the machine is.
In the present day, the great-grandson of Pinchas, Max Simkin is the cobbler. Jimmy operates the barber shop next door. Carmen Herrera, a young woman of the Lower East Side is fighting against large developers who are tearing down parts of the neighborhood to build huge complexes. Max doesn't seem to care at all about the shop. He lives at home with his ailing mother Sarah and wishes they could see Max's father again.
Local thug Leon Ludlow brings his shoes to the shop to resole them. Max's current stitching machine fails, so he uses the old one. He checks Ludlow's shoe size; it's 10 1/2, the same as his. Max tries the shoes on and transforms into Ludlow. He uses the machine on other shoes, and realizes what he can do with it.
Max experiments living as someone else, going to Chinatown as a Chinese man, going to a restaurant as one and leaving as another, not paying. Taryn brings in her British boyfriend Emiliano's shoes, and Max uses them. As Emiliano, he goes to a bar, noticed by beautiful women. One approaches him, noting that she once saw him leaving with a man. Going to his home as Emiliano, he finds Taryn taking a shower and she invites him to join her. He eagerly starts to undress, then realizes if he takes off a shoe, he will no longer be Emiliano, so he leaves. Max decides to make his mother happy by using the shoes of his father Abraham. Having dinner with Sarah as Abraham gives her one more night of happiness.
The next morning Sarah has died, so he and his family sit shiva for the week. When he returns to work, Ludlow demands his shoes back or he'll kill Max. Using several pairs of shoes to disguise himself, Max follows Ludlow to his apartment. Using Ludlow's shoes, he meets his girlfriend Macy, who has apparently been abused by Ludlow. Max searches for his valuable watches, which he takes; he also finds a cache of weapons. The real Ludlow returns and starts to strangle Max (still in Ludlow's shoes) until Max tasers him. Ludlow-Max goes with two associates of Ludlow where a man is held captive for stealing. About to kill him on Ludlow's orders, Ludlow-Max tells them to free him. Then they go meet slum lord Elaine Greenawalt, who gives him lots of money to buy out a man from his building.
Max goes back to Ludlow's wearing the transsexual's stilettos. Ludlow attacks, but stops when Max removes a shoe and reverts to himself. Resuming the attack, Max kills Ludlow with the shoe. Max turns himself in to the police, but when they go to the apartment, all the evidence is gone. He is left, alone and confused. Jimmy confronts Max about his recent odd behavior, telling Max the secret, that his father did the same thing before he disappeared.
Max goes with Carmen to Mr. Solomon's, the man Greenawalt wants to buy out. He refuses to leave, as he has lived there for decades and raised his daughter there. Max devises a plan to trick Greenawalt into giving him a large amount of money while still letting Solomon keep his home. When she realizes she's been played, she goes to Solomon's and threatens to kill him. She is caught on camera, and later arrested. Max's life starts to go back to normal. Carmen goes into the shop and invites him to dinner. He later goes to Ludlow's as Ludlow, giving the watches to Macy, telling her he's sorry and that she deserves better. As he leaves, he is abducted by a group of men led by the man he had saved. They are about to drive off when their car is struck.
He wakes up in Jimmy's barber shop and is offered some water and a pickle, as pickles help with the transition from one body to another. Max asks how he knew that, Jimmy takes off his shoes revealing that he is actually Abraham, his father. The real Jimmy is in the Caribbean. Both elated and angry, Max hugs his dad, then is shown a huge collection of shoes that he's gathered over the years. Abraham then takes Max in his limo through the city, telling him the story of how the stitching machine came into their family.

The Cobbler has been panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 10%, based on 70 reviews, with a weighted average score of 3.16/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "The Cobbler represents a slight step up from Adam Sandler's recent comedies, but while its cloying sentiment proves a more palatable substitute for his usual crass humor, it still isn't terribly compelling." On Metacritic, the film has a score of 23 out of 100, based on reviews from 22 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".Uri Klein of Haaretz pointed out that while The Cobbler is "one of the few times in Sandler's career in which he has chosen to work for a director with a certain pedigree", and "the plot has fantastical impersonation elements that links it to comedians of an earlier era, such as Jerry Lewis and Danny Kaye", the result is unsatisfying in terms of both plot and characters. The A.V. Club chose the film as the worst film of 2015. The Cobbler was discussed extensively on the October 22nd episode of Chapo Trap House during which the film was largely panned by the show's hosts.Jared Mobarak of The Film Stage gave the film a positive review, noting that "embraces its slightness to warm hearts" and praised Method Man in particular for his performance.
