== Plot summary ==
Years after a drunken car crash that almost took his life, Tommy Carter (Mackie) has reinvented himself as a therapist/spiritual advisor who advocates a synthesis of world religions and positivity. He's parlayed this vocation into a successful book release that one day draws the attention of Angel Sanchez (Whitaker), a profoundly troubled man fixated on the "untimely" death of his mother. When Carter takes on Sanchez as a personal client in an effort to raise funds for his indebted brother Ben (Epps), things quickly take a turn for the worse. Angel needs much more than a simple life coach. Plagued by visions of his dead mother, a seance is held by Carter in order for Angel to say goodbye to his mother at which point he suffers a mild breakdown. Subsequently Carter informs Angel he can no longer treat him. Angel then incapacitates and captures carter torturing him over the course of days- to confess his sins so to speak. After capturing Carters wife and brother it is revealed it was the brothers who accidentally ran over Angels mother the night of their accident. (Epps) then threw her, still living and crying out for help over a bridge to her death. Upon this revelation Angel untapes Carter, leaving him his gun and walks out. As he walks away from his home with his daughter he sees his smiling mother looking down on him and we hear a gunshot, as Carter narrates that both brothers souls are tainted from what happened with them & Angels mother that night
