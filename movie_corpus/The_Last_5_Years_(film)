The Last Five Years is a 2014 American musical romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Richard Lagravenese. Based on Jason Robert Brown's musical of the same name, the film stars Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan as married couple Cathy Hiatt and Jamie Wellerstein.
It presents their relationship out of chronological order, in a nonlinear narrative. Cathy's songs begin after they have separated and move backwards in time to the beginning of their courtship, while Jamie's songs start when they have first met and proceeds through their crumbling marriage.
The film premiered on September 7, 2014, in the Special Presentations section of the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was released in select theaters and on video on demand on February 13, 2015.


== Adaptation ==
The musical, as presented on stage, is a two-person show, with no other actors besides the ones playing Jamie and Cathy.  It consists almost exclusively of solo numbers; Jamie and Cathy alternate songs, do not share the other's time frame, almost never sing together and frequently are not even present while the other character unburdens themselves.  This gives each character space to present their side of the story, biases and all. In adapting for film, LaGravanese made the decision to have the other character present for each monologue, and a few extra pieces of dialogue were added to certain scenes. Apart from this, as well as a few of the lyrics being slightly altered, pretty much all of the music was exactly the same, and the order in which the songs were performed is identical to the stage show, although a drum track was added to the original band lineup, which doesn't appear in the stage lineup. Additionally, a number of other actors appear in other parts, with cameos from both Betsy Wolfe and the composer of the show Jason Robert Brown, though Jordan and Kendrick still provide the bulk of the dialogue and all of the singing.


== Plot ==
The story is told though song and takes place over a five-year period, from the relationship in 2009 to the divorce in 2014. It alternates between Cathy's songs moving backwards in time from their breakup, and songs featuring Jamie moving forward in time from when they first start dating. The two timelines meet at their wedding for the duet "The Next Ten Minutes," and continue past each other.

=== Critical response ===
The Last Five Years received mixed reviews from critics. Anna Kendrick's performance was met with widespread critical acclaim, with many citing it as the best performance of her career. Jeremy Jordan's performance was also met with positive reviews. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 60% approval rating, based on 101 reviews, with an average rating of 6.12/10. The site's critical consensus states, "The Last Five Years hits a few awkward notes in its transition from stage to screen, but its freshness and sincere charm – and well-matched stars – offer their own rewards." Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score, calculated an average score of 60 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".In The Observer, Jonathan Romney found the film to be "an enjoyable anomaly. The Last Five Years is not just a romcom for people who hate romcoms, it's also a musical – although people who devoutly hate those may not click with its literate wit and knowing, more-bitter-than-sweet poignancy". Less positively, he wrote: "It's not as cinematically confident as it might be: director Richard LaGravenese isn't always the most imaginative at providing visual settings", before adding, "this does feel like an organic film rather than a show forced into movie glad rags". Romney found the songs to be "unfailingly sharp, though one or two take on clunky rock colourings; even then, they're only as bad as, say, Billy Joel on one of his better days". He concluded, "It's a film to bring tears to the eyes of a cynic – in fact, a cynic might relish it more than anyone, since it's the counterpointing of exuberance with unashamed bleakness that makes The Last Five Years so rich. You may even, just possibly, come out humming the tunes."
