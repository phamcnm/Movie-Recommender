== Plot ==
Five young men pledge Lambda Lambda Phi Fraternity at the historically Black institution, Frederick Douglass University.  Student Zurich leads the pledge class as they endure big brother hazing on campus and at line ups at fraternity house. The pledges balance their time in class with English professor Hughes and their new fraternity life of parties, sorority girls and dating.  The pledge class learns the brotherhood mottos and bonds together because of or despite moral and physical hazing.
Dean Richardson, a Lambda Phi alumnus, holds himself out as an example of the fraternity system and extols its virtues.  He makes himself available to be told of pledge abuse but not far enough to break the fraternity code of silence and secrecy.  One night the hazing goes too far and a big brother advises the pledge class to drop off a seriously injured pledge at the emergency room but to avoid the cameras.  Despite the advice, the young neophyte fraternity brothers wait together at the hospital awaiting the fate of their friend, Frank. After seconds of waiting the doctor tells them that Frank died of a ruptured aorta artery. Zurich takes out his cell phone and calls his dad, realizing why his father never joined the fraternity, and the movie ends.
