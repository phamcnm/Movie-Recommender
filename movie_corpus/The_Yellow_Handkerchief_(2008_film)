Along the way, the three reflect on their existence, struggle for acceptance, and find their way not only through Louisiana, but through life. Directed by Udayan Prasad and produced by Arthur Cohn, the film was shown at Sundance in 2008 and given a limited release on February 26, 2010, by Samuel Goldwyn Films.


== Plot ==
After being released from prison after six years, ex-convict Brett Hanson becomes lost in a new and unfamiliar world of freedoms and responsibilities. Struggling to reconcile himself with his disastrous past, he embarks on a journey to his home of south Louisiana to reunite with the ex-wife he left behind, May. Along this journey, he meets two teenagers: Martine, a troubled 15-year-old who has just escaped her family, and Gordy, a geeky outcast desperately seeking acceptance. Martine and Gordy offer to give Brett a lift home, and on the ensuing road trip the three reflect on their own personal misfit status while discovering in themselves and each other the acceptance each so deeply desires. Brett weighs whether to start a new life or rekindle his love with May – he's not sure she'll take him back – while Martine reevaluates her relationships with boys and her family and Gordy struggles with his affection for Martine.

== Production ==
In 2003, Cohn obtained remake rights for The Yellow Handkerchief from Shochiku. Financing came from private investments rather than through pre-sales. Cohn commented saying "The money came from four Europeans — three women from Switzerland: Annette Grisard, Jeannine Eckenstein, Esther Grether and a gentleman by the name of Samuel Falk from Austria — all of whom were anxious to support a film they hoped would be memorable without any scenes of violence, brutality or sex. These investors were not concerned that the film would be considered "small." They felt, as we do, that there are no small films or big films, only films which are good and emotional and others which are not."Filming took place in February 2007 and was shot in 43 different locations.Hurt prepared for his role by spending four days at Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, including a rare overnight for a volunteer in a maximum-security cell. In an interview, he said he'd also done "[y]ou'd call it charitable work... periodically visit[ing] the prisons in Rockland County in New York State to take a program of hope and self-rehabilitation to" the prisoners.
