Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.In his review for TheWrap, Alonso Duralde found the film uneven, and it "doesn’t even provide the comfort-food delights of a well-made formulaic genre film. Neither the central romance, nor the movie around it, ever catches fire." Writing for RogerEbert.com, Sheila O'Malley gave the film 2.5/4 stars, calling it predictable but semi-charming. Dave Palmer of The Reel Deal gave the film 4/10, but admitted he had fun watching it because of how stupid it is. In a positive review for The New York Times, Glenn Kenny commented, "the movie sticks to its philosophical guns, such as they are, in a way that’s almost unheard of in contemporary romantic comedies."
