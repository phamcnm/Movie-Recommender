Vivaan and Siya Agasthi struggle to make ends meet. The couple win a trip to the beautiful island nation of Fiji in a lucky draw. The holiday is fully sponsored, with luxurious hotel accommodation and fine dinners. The duo fly to Fiji to celebrate their wedding anniversary and encounter the charming Mr. Khan at the resort. Mr. Khan invites the couple to participate in a live game show called Table No. 21. He tells them that the winner of the game bags a staggering amount of ₹210 million as prize money. He outlines the rules which are eight personal questions asked that must be answered truthfully, and following this, one must complete a task related to the question. The couple decides to enter the game show. At first, the questions seem easy, but as the game progresses, the tasks become increasingly horrific connected to their college life. Vivaan's final task is to murder an individual. He is led to a room, where he is to face his target. When he sees the person he must kill, he recognises him from his past. A flashback shows Vivaan and his friends ragging a boy, named Akram. The severe bullying made Akram mentally challenged. Back in the present, it is revealed that Akram is Mr. Khan's son, and that Mr. Khan's intention was to exact revenge and show Vivaan and Siya the damage inflicted on Akram by their actions. Mr. Khan tells them that they are free to go but their sins will follow them everywhere. The movie ends as Vivaan and Siya are still shocked – crying and  regretting their choices.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 54% based on 3 reviews. Indiaglitz.com says that "Table No. 21 keeps you engaged right from start to the finish. If the beginning portions are frothy, middle portions turn thrilling, post interval is dramatic and ultimately the narrative turns dark before reaching a shocking end." Ankur Pathak of Rediff.com says that "Table No. 21 should be watched for the reactive social commentary that it is, and should not be misconceived as a vigilante film." Rated it 3 out of 5 stars. Madhureeta Mukherjee of The Times of India rated the film 3/5 
stars. Rajeev Masand of IBNLive.com says that "Table No. 21 squanders its potential. The film's ending is bold, but little else is consistent or 
gripping".  Mansha Rastogi of Nowrunning.com says that "Table No. 21, although may not be a completely out of the box, never before concept but it's the execution of the story and the acting that makes this film a one time watch."
