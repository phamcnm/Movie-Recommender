== Plot ==
Lara Jean Covey's high school sets up a volunteer program; while her boyfriend Peter Kavinsky volunteers with his friends, Lara Jean goes to Belleview Retirement Home instead,  where her older sister Margot went. 
On her first day there, she meets Stormy, an eccentric old lady who Margot often mentioned and discovers that John Ambrose McClaren is also volunteering at Belleview. They talk about a love letter she had written to him many years ago, and he lets her read the letter as long as she gives it back to him afterward. Lara Jean is unable to stop thinking about their conversation and, in addition, is constantly insecure about her relationship with Peter because she can't stop comparing herself with her ex-best friend, and Peter's ex-girlfriend, Gen.
On Valentine's Day, Lara Jean witnesses her classmates being serenaded by special acapella groups and is told by a friend that Peter had sent a group to serenade Gen every period, back when they were still dating. This enhances her insecurity, though she forgets about this when she meets with Peter later that day. He gives her a silver heart necklace and reads a poem, which she believes is original but turns out to be two verses of an Edgar Allan Poe poem. He later apologizes and tells her he wishes he could write something like that for her, though he means everything in the poem.
While volunteering at Belleview, Lara Jean and John Ambrose grow closer and throw a Star Ball for Belleview after discovering some old decorations; He appears to be developing feelings for her, who hasn't told him about her relationship with Peter. Instead, they arrange to go to their old middle school hangout spot, a treehouse, to dig up the time capsule they buried years ago with their friends, including Gen, and take turns unpacking it. Gen claims that she didn't put any in the time capsule,  Peter gets jealous of John Ambrose and reveals his relationship with Lara Jean. She and Peter argue but end up making up.
The next day, Lara Jean apologizes to John Ambrose for not telling him about Peter, and then dresses up for Peter's game. As she is waiting for Peter to come out, Chris shows her a photo of Gen and him. She confronts Peter and realizes that Peter never stopped talking to Gen and, on the ski trip, Peter was planning to get back together with Gen that night. As Peter is in a rush to get to the game, he tells Lara Jean they will have to talk about it later, but she's too hurt and breaks up with him. She goes to the treehouse later and meets Gen, who reveals that Peter was only comforting her as her parents are separating. She went to Peter because he had undergone the same experience, that Peter is crazy about Lara Jean, and that she shouldn't doubt him. She also reveals that she had, in fact, put a friendship bracelet identical to Lara Jean's in the capsule, and was too embarrassed to show it. Lara Jean realizes that it was her and not Peter who always had Gen on her mind, and makes up with Gen.
On the night of the retirees' ball, Stormy gives Lara Jean a dress and a makeover. She and John Ambrose dance before going outside in the snow. When they kiss, Lara Jean realizes that she truly loves Peter and doesn't hold feelings for John. She apologizes to him and rushes outside, surprised to find Peter waiting outside for her. He is waiting outside because he remembers she doesn't like driving in the snow, a fact that she told him on their first date. He says that she can break his heart if she wants, but she says that she loves him instead, and he tells her he loves her back. They kiss and make up, and in an ending voiceover Lara Jean says that she had wanted a fairytale relationship with Peter, but is now satisfied with what she has.

=== Development ===
In August 2018, Jenny Han, author of the source novel, said of a film sequel to To All the Boys I've Loved Before, which would adapt Han's second book in the series, P.S. I Still Love You:

There's so many things in the second book that I would love to see in a sequel. The whole reason why I wrote a second book was for the character of John Ambrose McClaren, who is a fan favorite, and he's a favorite of mine too. I would love to see that explored, and also there's a character called Stormy that I love to write. I would love to see that.
In November 2018, it was reported that Netflix and Paramount Pictures' Awesomeness Films were in discussions to produce a sequel, and Netflix announced the development of a sequel featuring Condor and Centineo in December 2018.
