Murder on a Sunday Morning (French: Un coupable id√©al) is a French-American documentary film directed by Jean-Xavier de Lestrade. Its subject is the Brenton Butler case, a criminal case in which a fifteen-year-old boy was wrongfully accused of murder. The film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 74th Academy Awards in 2002.


== Summary ==
Brenton Butler was arrested and tried for the murder of a tourist in Jacksonville, Florida. The prosecution's case relied heavily upon a positive eyewitness identification made by the victim's husband, and on Butler's confession, which the teen testified was the result of physical coercion by police. The film follows Butler's defense team building their case for his innocence.


== Aftermath ==
After Butler was acquitted, the police and the prosecutors were heavily criticized by a grand jury who investigated the case and the behavior of the police. Eventually, the Duval County sheriff was put in charge of the case who ordered the case reopened. In 2004, a different man was convicted of the murder.
