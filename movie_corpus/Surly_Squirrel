== Reception ==
A reviewer for the Washington Post described Surly as a "selfish scurrier" with a "grouchy attitude and a "mind for schemes", concluding that "He's not a very fun character to travel with". In 2014, a reviewer in IGN described the character as "admittedly quite surly", but also "trapped in a bizarre and contradictory social commentary about the importance of sharing and the dangers of socialism."
 A reviewer for the New York Times described the character as a "dour squirrel" prone to tantrums.
