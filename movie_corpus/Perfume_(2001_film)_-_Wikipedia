== Plot ==
Prior to a major fashion show, the people involved find themselves embroiled in their own personal battles.
Lorenzo Mancini (Paul Sorvino) is a famous Italian fashion designer who learns that he's dying of cancer, but keeps the news from his former wife Irene (Sônia Braga) and his boyfriend Guido (Peter Gallagher) while also trying to prevent his son Mario (Michael Sorvino) from changing their family business into a new line pandering to hip hop culture.
Camille (Leslie Mann) is a up-and-coming fashion designer who's leaving the small atelier owned by Roberta Colaredo (Rita Wilson) to join the large fashion house Fantasia, for which her current lover, Jamie (Jeff Goldblum), works as a talent scout.
Anthony (Jared Harris) is a fashion photographer who has to reinvent himself after his signature heroin chic style has become overused and obvious. Janice Crawford (Joanne Baron), powerful chief editor of A Magazine, offers Anthony the chance to prove himself with a cover shot. In the meantime, Janice's estranged daughter Halley (Michelle Williams) resurfaces unexpectedly.
