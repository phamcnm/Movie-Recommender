== Plot ==
Craig's father Willie decides it would be safer for Craig to move to Rancho Cucamonga and live with his uncle Elroy and cousin Day-Day, who had won the lottery and were able to afford a nice house in the suburbs. Day-Day shows Craig around the house and neighborhood. Day-Day explains to Craig that after winning the lottery, all of the taxes and fees that were taken out only left them enough to buy their house and car. However, a notice arrives that their house could be repossessed, but Day-Day is running late for work and unable to bring it to his dad's attention.
Later, Craig visits Day-Day at work. A customer comes into the store and attempts to scam Day-Day by returning a broken CD. Craig arrives and sees the customer harassing Day-Day. Craig throws him out. Day-Day finds D’Wana vandalizing his car with Baby D for the second time that day, and attempts to confront them, but is attacked by Baby D. Pinky arrives at the store finding that it locked up while Day-Day and his co-worker Roach are in the back. After an armed scuffle with Craig in which Pinky mistook him for a robber, the former gains the upper hand and explains that he is Day-Day’s cousin. When Day-Day returns and confirms this, Pinky fires Day-Day and Roach. Craig, Day-Day and Roach try to figure out how to keep the house. Craig remembers seeing one of the neighbors, the Jokers, carrying a hydraulic pump. Suspecting that they may be hiding cash inside, Craig convinces Day-Day and Roach to help him get inside the Jokers house and see what’s inside the pump.
The trio drug the Jokers guard dog Chico. Craig sneaks into the Jokers house while the three brothers are partying. Craig locates the pump and confirms that cash is hidden inside, taking some for himself. He escapes out of a window. Meanwhile, Day-Day and Roach knock on the Jokers front door, which is answered by all three brothers armed with guns. The brothers take Day-Day and Roach hostage while trying to figure out what happened to their money.
Willie returns to the neighborhood while unknowingly hauling Deebo and his brother Tyrone in his truck, both having been tracking Craig down after they escaped from prison so Deebo could have revenge. Craig returns to Elroy's house inquiring of the whereabouts of Day-Day and Roach. He, Willie, and Elroy deduce they are still in the Joker brothers’ house. They form a plan to get the two out while Auntie Suga informs them that if they aren’t back in ten minutes she will be calling the police. 
The trio sneak into the backyard of the Jokers’ house. Joker sends Baby Joker to get a chainsaw from the toolshed, only for the latter to be knocked out by Willie. This lures out Lil Joker who Elroy incapacitates by tackling him. Willie ties the younger Jokers up and puts them in the shed. Joker goes out to look for his brothers and notices Elroy still lying on the ground. This distraction is enough for Craig to engage him in a fist fight with Joker. As Craig has Joker distracted, Elroy recovers enough to free Day-Day and Roach. They try to help Craig with Joker, but the latter gains the upper hand and is about to shoot the trio before Deebo appears and knocks him out. He acquires an assault rifle as Chico arrives and bites him in the arm. The police arrive and arrest the Joker brothers, Deebo, and Tyrone. Craig hands the cash from the pump over to his uncle. Craig returns home with his dad.
