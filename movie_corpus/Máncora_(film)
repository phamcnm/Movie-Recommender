== Synopsis ==
From the director of La mujer de mi hermano and the writer of Voces inocentes comes Máncora, a road-trip drama that traces the shifting emotional boundaries between three disconnected individuals.
Máncora begins with Santiago (Jason Day), a 21-year-old from Lima who is disturbed by his father's recent and unexpected suicide. Wanting to leave the chill of a grey Lima winter, Santiago decides to go to Máncora, a beach town in the north of the country where the climate is warmer. Right before his departure, Santiago receives an unexpected visit from his stepsister Ximena (Elsa Pataky), an energetic Spanish photographer and her husband Iñigo (Enrique Murciano), an art collector from New York. Their peaceful getaway is quickly disrupted by an act of boundary-crossing and betrayal, which might change their relationship forever.
