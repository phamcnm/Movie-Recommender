Movies 3 is the third compilation DVD by the Japanese hip-hop group Lead, released on August 6, 2008 under the Pony Canyon sub-label Flight Master. The DVD reached #40 on the Oricon DVD charts, staying on the charts for two consecutive weeks. It was their first compilation to not be released as both a DVD and VHS, only carrying a DVD release. This was due to the decline of the VHS market as the optical disc, namely the DVD, began taking on popularity.The DVD housed every music video the group had released from their debut song "Manatsu no Magic" (2002), to their then-most recent video "Sunnyday" (2008). Their next compilation DVD, Movies 4, would not be released until eight years later in May 2015.The cover art was shot in the same location as their music video for "Sunnyday", which was primarily filmed in an empty swimming pool. The group even donned the outfits worn in the shoot.
