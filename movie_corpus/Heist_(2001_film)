== Critical reception ==
Heist received generally positive reviews from critics. Slant Magazine called the documentary "remarkably balanced and even-toned." It was designated a Critics' Pick by The New York Times, with Stephen Holden remarking that the film "has the virtue of taking the long view of a crisis that recent films like Inside Job and Too Big to Fail have only sketchily explored." Nick Schager, in The Village Voice, criticized the film's structure, writing that "Combining archival news broadcasts and photos, contemporary protest footage, talking-head interviews, and graphical and cartoon interludes, it's a work that continues the liberal-political documentary subgenre's own war against aesthetic maturity and inventiveness." Kam Williams of AALBC.com called the film "A persuasive case for the swift reinstatement of watchdog laws to prevent bailed-out Wall Street from turning the American Dream into a neverending nightmare for folks on Main Street."
