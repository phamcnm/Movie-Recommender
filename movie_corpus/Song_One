== Plot ==
Franny Ellis (Anne Hathaway), an anthropology student, returns home from her PhD thesis work in Morocco to see her estranged brother, Henry (Ben Rosenfield), a musician who entered a coma after being hit by a car. To revive Henry and repair their relationship, Franny uses writings from Henry's journal to travel among New York City music clubs, where she takes notes on the phrases and music she observes. She fills Henry's sterile hospital room with familiar sounds and scents. Eventually, Franny meets Henry's favorite musician, James Forester (Johnny Flynn), at his concert, and convinces him to play for Henry. Franny and James explore New York City through Henry's experiences, develop a romantic relationship, and Henry awakens.

== Production ==
Initially, Franny was written as 19 years old, however after Anne Hathaway came aboard, Barker-Froyland rewrote the part to be that of an older woman, which she notes worked well for the script as it gave Franny more reason to not want to be a musician. Hathaway's previous movie Les Mis√©rables required her to adopt a shorter hair style than usual, rather than make her regrow the hair, the director incorporated it into the script.Filming of Song One began in June 2013 in New York City.


== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack, released by Lakeshore Records on January 13, 2015, contained original scores written by Jenny Lewis and Johnathan Rice of the indie rock duo Jenny & Johnny. Barker-Froyland met with the duo in Los Angeles and, after she listened to "Little Yellow Dress" before her plane ride to New York, decided that they would create the songs that Flynn would perform in-character.
During production, Song One producer Jonathan Demme instructed Lewis and Rice to record its music as Skip Spence recorded his 1969 psychedelic album Oar. The duo wrote eleven songs for the film, though only seven were used in its composition.
