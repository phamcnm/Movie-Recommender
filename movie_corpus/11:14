As of May 2018, 11:14 holds a 92% "fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 12 reviews. Mick LaSalle, of the San Francisco Chronicle, called it an "inventive, black comedy" and "a meticulous piece of plot construction, entertaining, full of incidents and infused throughout with a mischievous and bleak sense of humor." Lisa Nesselson of Variety praised the film as a "zippy and sardonic feast of bad decision-making under pressure" that "artfully molds the seemingly unrelated misfortunes of 10 characters into a satisfying and consistently entertaining whole." Time Out gave the film a mixed review, noting: "Marcks mounts all this as an essay in synchronicity, replete with flashbacks, overlaps, connections and black humour...  there are some outrageous, funny moments and Marcks directs with minor panache. But itâ€™s ultimately an unsatisfactory experience, akin to observing someone else fill in a crossword puzzle."
