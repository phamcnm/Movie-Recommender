== Plot ==
A bank is simultaneously attacked by two groups of robbers: three high-tech professionals and two rustic buffoons.  One bystander (possibly an FBI agent) is quickly shot and killed, seemingly by accident, and eight hostages taken.  One of the hostages, a customer (Tripp), notices several puzzling details, from which he guesses that coincidences were intentional: The robbers (among others) were lured here, with misleading blueprints and defective equipment, so that another criminal (the bank manager, Gordon Blythe, who is in reality mastermind criminal Vicellous Drum) – at the top of the FBI's wanted list of bank robbers – could kill them to cover his own trail. Tripp falls in love with Kaitlin as they are held hostage by a bunch of robbers and in the end it turns out that Kaitlin was the biggest thief herself. Tripp also correctly figures out that Kaitlin knew of Blythe-Drum's plan, and ultimately robs the bank with the security guards carrying out the loot for her near the end. Then, Kaitlin and Tripp drive off with the proceeds.
