== Plot ==
Unable to afford the tuition needed to fund her private school education, Rayanna or Raya (Rutina Wesley) returns to her family home in the city while reluctantly re-evaluating her future. Upon learning that the top prize for an upcoming step-dancing competition is $50,000, Raya uses her impressive moves to earn a coveted slot in her good friend Bishop's (Dwain Murphy) predominantly male JSJ crew. Isolated from the local women due to jealousy and separated from her fellow dancers by her sex, the ambitious dancer is subsequently kicked off the team for showing off during a preliminary competition. Now, if Raya has any hope of realizing her medical school dreams, she will have to either earn back Bishop's trust or organize her own dance crew and start over from scratch. In the end, she eventually learns "how she move".

== Production and release ==
How She Move was originally slated to open in Canada in March 2007, but when it picked up a distribution deal from American companies Paramount Vantage and MTV Films (both owned by Viacom) at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, the release date was pushed back to allow for reshooting several of the dance sequences, particularly the finale. The film was shot on Super 16mm for $5 million, and Paramount invested another $2 million in the new sequences, re-editing and new sound mix. They created a new soundtrack with American and Canadian hip-hop artists. The film was originally set and shot in Toronto, however; Paramount edited out references of the team travelling from Toronto to Detroit for the dance competition following test audience screenings. They, along with MTV, spent another $10 million in promotion and distribution to 1500 theatres in the United States and 50 in Canada.
