The Real Cancun is a 2003 American reality film directed by Rick de Oliveira and written by Brian Caldirola. Inspired by the reality television genre, this film followed the lives of sixteen Americans from March 13–23, 2003 as they celebrated spring break in Cancún, Mexico and experienced romantic relationships, emotional strife, or just had a good time.The film received negative critical reviews and was a box office flop, earning a little over $5 million in the United States from a $7.5 million budget. Most of the film's cast returned to general obscurity after release, with the exception of Laura Ramsey, who launched an acting career.

=== Critical response ===
The Real Cancun received generally negative reviews from critics (with Variety's Scott Foundas causing to remark in his review that The Real Cancun billed itself as "the first reality feature film" is "apparently ignoring last year's Jackass The Movie"). On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 35% score based on 88 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The site's consensus states: "The footage is predictable and rather tame, and most of the people are uninteresting."

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "C−" on an A+ to F scale.


=== Awards and nominations ===

== Aftermath ==
A reality movie based upon the Girls Gone Wild video series that MGM bought the rights to was never put into production and the Universal Pictures effort Drunken Jackasses: The Quest was delayed after the flop of Cancun and went straight to video.
