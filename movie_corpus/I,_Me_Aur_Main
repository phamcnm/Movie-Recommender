== Critical reception ==
I, Me aur Main received mixed reviews from critics. Alisha Coelho of in.com gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and said that the movie was "proof that a movie with John Abraham as the lead can be your time and money's worth and that Bollywood can (if it tried) make love stories that don't defy common sense and good taste."
Nishi Tiwari for Rediff.com has given 2/5 stars and says I, Me Aur Main has its moments but falters badly with its plot.


== Box office ==
I, Me, Aur Main opened to poor collections. The film had little growth on the weekend, but the collections were still low and was eventually declared a flop.


== Soundtrack ==
One song from Sridevi starrer 1989 Bollywood comedy film ChaalBaaz "Na Jaane Kahan Se Aayi Hai" was re-created in the film. The album consists of seven tracks composed by four musicians — Sachin - Jigar, Gourov Dasgupta, Pakistani artist Falak Shabir and Raghav Sachar. Musicperk.com rated the album 7.5/10 quoting "Saajna, Naa Jaane, Darbadar (written by Mayur Puri), Meri Jaaniye are the picks of the album." The track "Capuchino" was a rip-off from the original song "I'm Shipping Up to Boston" and the track "Na Jaane" is a rip-off of "Part-Time Lover" a 1985 single by Stevie Wonder, from his album In Square Circle.
