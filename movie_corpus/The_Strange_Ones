== Plot ==
A house fire sends a teenage boy, Sam, and a twenty-something man, Nick, on a road trip across rural America. As they head to a location where Nick believes they can both find a second chance, they tell people at diners and rest stops that they're brothers Nick and Jeremiah and on a vacation. Seeming jealousy on Sam's part over anyone spending time with Nick, soon suggests that some darker relationship exists between the two males except it was his Dad abusing him. At the same time, Sam has difficulty interpreting the difference between reality and dreams. Nick tells him that it doesn't matter and that Sam can turn his dreams into reality.
