Kumaré premiered at the 2011 South by Southwest Film Festival (SXSW), where it received the festival's Feature Film Audience Award for Best Documentary Feature.Kumaré received fair reviews upon release.  Many movie reviewers criticized Gandhi's deception as immoral, but had partial forgiveness for Gandhi for realizing that the experiment had grown out of his control.
