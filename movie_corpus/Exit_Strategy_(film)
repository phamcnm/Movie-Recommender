Exit Strategy is a 2012 American independent romantic comedy film directed by Michael Whitton and starring Jameel Saleem, Kimelia Weathers, Quincy "QDeezy" Harris, with cameo appearances by L.A. radio host Big Boy and stand-up comedian Kevin Hart. Saleem plays a man whose main goal is to not get the girl, but to lose her—thus marketed as a self-described "un-romantic comedy." The film originated as a seven-part web series that had been running since 2007.


== Plot ==
James (Jameel Saleem), likeable but irresponsible, moves in with his take-charge girlfriend of three months Kim (Kimelia Weathers), and quickly discovers she's everything he never wanted in a woman.  With advice from his childhood best friends and second-hand goods store co-workers Carville (Quincy "QDeezy" Harris) and Leona (Noelle Balfour), he tries to make the relationship work instead of being homeless; but may have to be resigned to his new life and living situation: chores and no football on Sundays, snoring instead of sleep, and no TV in the bedroom—ever!  But after a disastrous dinner with Kim's father, and on the advice of high-schooler Scoop, strangers Big Boy and customer Mannequin Head Man (Kevin Hart), James tries to get her to break up with him but still let him sleep on the couch.  It doesn't work, and James has to tell Kim the painful truth, making her realize he wasn't what she wanted after all.
