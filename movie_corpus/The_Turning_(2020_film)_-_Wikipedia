Aphton Corbin, Brian Fee, Kristen Lester and Rosana Sullivan have been working on their untitled feature films. In 2018, FC Barcelona entered talks with Pixar to create a film.


=== Production cycle ===
In July 2013, Pixar Studios President Edwin Catmull said that the studio planned to release one original film each year, and a sequel every other year, as part of a strategy to release "one and a half movies a year." On July 3, 2016, Pixar president Jim Morris announced that the studio would be moving away from sequels after Toy Story 4 and Pixar was only developing original ideas with five films in development at the time of the announcement.


=== Cancelled projects ===
Back when they were still a part of Lucasfilm in 1985, they started pre-production of a movie called Monkey. After they spun off as a new company in 1986, they were still working on it. In the end they realized they had to abandon it because of technical limitations.In 2005, Pixar began collaborating with Disney and Warner Bros. on a live-action film adaptation of James Dalessandro's novel 1906, with Brad Bird announced as the director. It would have marked Pixar's first involvement in a live-action production and their first collaboration with a major production company other than Disney. Disney and Pixar left the project due to script problems and an estimated budget of $200 million, and it is in limbo at Warner Bros., However in June 2018, Bird mentioned the possibility of adapting the novel as a TV series, and the earthquake sequence as a live-action feature film.A Pixar film titled Newt (which was set to be directed by Gary Rydstrom) was announced in April 2008, with Pixar planning to release it in 2011, which was later delayed to 2012, but it had finally been canceled by early 2010. John Lasseter noted that the film's proposed plot line was similar to another film, Blue Sky Studios' Rio, which was released in 2011. In a March 2014 interview, Pixar president Edwin Catmull stated that Newt was an idea that was not working in pre-production. When the project was passed to Pete Docter, the director of Monsters, Inc. and Up, he pitched an idea that Pixar thought was better, and that concept became Inside Out.In 2010, Henry Selick formed a joint venture with Pixar called Cinderbiter Productions, which was to exclusively produce stop-motion films. Its first project under the deal, a film titled ShadeMaker was set to be released on October 4, 2013, but was canceled in August 2012 due to creative differences. An adaptation of Neil Gaiman's novel The Graveyard Book was also planned. Selick was given the option to shop ShadeMaker (now titled The Shadow King) to other studios. In January 2013, Ron Howard was hired to direct The Graveyard Book.In addition, when the now-defunct Circle 7 Animation was open, there were plans for sequels to Finding Nemo (for which Pixar made their own sequel, Finding Dory) and Monsters, Inc. (for which Pixar made a prequel, Monsters University), as well as a different version of Toy Story 3. Pixar's later sequels had no basis in Circle 7's projects, and were created completely separately.
