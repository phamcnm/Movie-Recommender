Mission: Impossible is a series of American action spy films based on and a follow-on from the television series of the same name created by Bruce Geller. The series is mainly produced by and stars Tom Cruise, whose character is Ethan Hunt, an agent of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF). The films have been directed, written, and scored from various filmmakers and crew, while incorporating musical themes from the original series by Lalo Schifrin.
Beginning in 1996, the films (taking place starting six years after the events of the previous TV sequel series) follow the missions of the IMF's main field team under the leadership of Hunt to stop an enemy force all the while preventing an impending global disaster. The series focuses on Hunt as the lead character as opposed to the ensemble cast structure of the television series, although some characters, such as Luther Stickell (played by Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (played by Simon Pegg) have recurring roles in the films.
The series has received a positive reception from critics and audiences alike, and is the 16th-highest-grossing film series of all time, with a worldwide gross of over $3.5 billion to date, and is often cited as one of the best action franchises to date. The sixth and most recent film, titled Mission: Impossible – Fallout, was released on July 27, 2018. The seventh and the upcoming film, with the working title Mission: Impossible 7, is scheduled to release on May 27, 2022.
All of the Mission: Impossible films are co-produced and released by Paramount Pictures (and from Ghost Protocol onwards are also co-produced by Bad Robot Productions and Skydance Media) and are rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association.

In January 2019, it was announced that both a seventh and an eighth Mission: Impossible were in development, with Christopher McQuarrie set to return as both writer and director of both films. Reportedly filmed back-to-back, the movies were originally scheduled for release on July 23, 2021 and August 5, 2022. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, these dates were changed to May 27, 2022 and July 7, 2023 respectively.In September 2019, McQuarrie announced via his Instagram account that Hayley Atwell had joined the cast for both films, which was later confirmed by the actor. Two months later, the director also revealed the involvement of Pom Klementieff and in late December Shea Whigham was confirmed as a cast member for the two upcoming movies. In January 2020, McQuarrie further announced that Nicholas Hoult had also joined the cast and Simon Pegg confirmed his return as Benji later the same month. In February 2020, McQuarrie announced that Henry Czerny would reprise his role as Eugene Kittridge from the first film, whilst Vanessa Kirby confirmed her return as Alanna/White Widow.

=== Change to theme music ===
The television version is in a rarely used 54 time (an unusual time signature with five crotchets to a bar) and is difficult to dance to, as was proven by a memorable segment of American Bandstand in which teenage dancers were caught off-guard by Dick Clark's playing of the Lalo Schifrin single release.
The opening theme music for the first six films are stylized renditions of Schifrin's original iconic theme, preserving the 54 rhythm, by Danny Elfman, Hans Zimmer, Michael Giacchino, Joe Kraemer and Lorne Balfe, respectively. Most of the versions included in the score also retained the 54 time signature.However, for Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen, Jr.'s version featured on the first film's motion picture soundtrack, the time signature was changed to standard pop 44 time to make it more dance-friendly, although the intro is still in 54 time. The Limp Bizkit song "Take a Look Around" from the soundtrack to the second film was set to a similar 44 modification of the theme, with an interlude in 54.
