He is approached by Graciella Rivers; her sister, Gloria, was murdered during a robbery and she asks him to solve the case. He discovers that the heart transplanted into him was Gloria's. He has nightmares of the robbery during which Gloria was murdered. 
McCaleb, against the advice of his physician, decides to find the murderer with the help of houseboat neighbor Buddy and local police detective Jaye Winston. McCaleb's path leads to several suspects, but he eventually realizes that Buddy is the murderer.
