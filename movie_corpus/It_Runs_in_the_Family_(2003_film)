== Reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 28% and an average rating of 4.5/10.  The site's consensus states, "Despite its gimmick casting, the movie ultimately goes nowhere."  Critic Steven Holden wrote in The New York Times that the film is a "surprisingly complex and subtle portrait", and "Besides its laudable reluctance to tie up loose ends, the most courageous thing about It Runs in the Family is its refusal to try to make you love its aggressive, strong-willed characters."  Roger Ebert wrote: "But the movie is simply not clear about where it wants to go and what it wants to do. It is heavy on episode and light on insight, and although it takes courage to bring up touchy topics it would have taken more to treat them frankly."
