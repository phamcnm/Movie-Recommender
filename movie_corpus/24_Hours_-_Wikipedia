Film trailers are excluded here. Out of the top twenty most-viewed videos, three artists have more than one video listed: BTS has seven entries, Blackpink has four, and Taylor Swift has two.
In September 2019, YouTube changed their policy on video view counts and excluded paid advertising views from future 24-hour statistics.


=== Controversy ===
In July 2019, there was some controversy regarding the legitimacy of YouTube's 24 hour records, after Indian hip hop rapper Badshah's song "Paagal" received 75 million views in 24 hours, and surpassed the viewership record of "Boy with Luv" by K-pop group BTS and American singer Halsey. YouTube did not congratulate Badshah like it did for previous record holders and later released a statement that Badshah's record label, Sony Music India, had purchased advertisements from Google and YouTube that embedded the video or directed fans to it in some way. It also emerged that this is a common practice in the global music industry, and similar methods had also been used by the record labels of previous record holders such as Ariana Grande, Blackpink and Taylor Swift, thus casting doubt on some of the past 24-hour viewership records on YouTube. On September 13, 2019, YouTube announced that their charts will no longer include paid advertising views. In a statement to Forbes the following day, the platform also confirmed that "Based on our long-time criteria, Badshah did not qualify for our 24 hour debut records list".
