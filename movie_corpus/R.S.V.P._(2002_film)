Scott Foundas of Variety called it a "loud, crass redo of Hitchcock's Rope" with unlikable characters.  Kimberley Jones wrote in The Austin Chronicle that R.S.V.P.'s "inability to stick to a tone makes for a wildly uneven film, but also a mostly entertaining one, too".R.S.V.P. won best film at the Malibu Film Festival.
