Using the internet and old-school mafia traditions, a crew of young gangsters led by Nicholas "Nicky" Santini attempt to pull off the biggest heist in the history of the mafia. Nicky must first convince his uncle Danny Santini, a respected caporegime of the Genovesso crime family in New Jersey, to put up the necessary "seed money", $50 million. When Danny agrees, Nicky along his partner and friend Johnny "Irish" Kelly use violence and murder to put the plan in motion. But as much as things seem to be changing in the family's way of doing business, old habits and traditions remain and Nicholas must decide between his friends who helped him pull off the scam or his uncle Danny.
