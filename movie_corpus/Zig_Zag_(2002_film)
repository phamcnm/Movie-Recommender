== Plot ==
Dean Singer (John Leguizamo) has terminal cancer, yet is determined to spend his last days taking care of his 15-year-old autistic protégé from the Big Brother program, Louis "Zig Zag" Fletcher (Sam Jones III). Dean got Louis a dishwasher job in shamelessly abusive, exploitative Mr. Walters' (Oliver Platt) restaurant. Louis' dead-beat, neglecting yet abusive dad pushes him for "rent", which he actually uses to repay violent loan-shark Cadillac Tom (Luke Goss). Zig Zag gets it by stealing from Walters' safe, remembering numbers being his only talent. Singer is determined to return the money, despite excessive risks, with surprising allies.
