== Plot ==
Marketing executive Charlie Hinton and his best friend, Phil Ryerson, find themselves fired when their boss, CEO Jim Fields, shuts down the company's entire health division due to children disliking new, healthy breakfast cereals made from vegetables. 
While his wife Kim supports the family by returning to work as a lawyer, Charlie, after six weeks of job hunting, is forced to take their young son Ben out of Chapman Academy - an expensive and over-academic preschool headed by Gwyneth Harridan. Unable to find a satisfactory alternative, Charlie opens a daycare center in his home with the help of Phil, calling it "Daddy Day Care". Although local parents are suspicious of men working with kids, a few choose their service as it's cheaper and more child-based.
Charlie and Phil open with a few children, struggling at first with chaos, and some personal issues. Angered at the competition, Harridan attempts to shut them down, notifying child services of the new daycare. Charlie and Phil find themselves rectifying problems pointed out by Dan Kubitz, a director of child services, to ensure their daycare is suitable for children, including hiring their former colleague Marvin as an additional care provider. 
In time, they slowly begin to enjoy running Daddy Day Care, which grows in popularity, and bonding with the kids, with Charlie delighted to see Ben enjoying himself. However, Harridan continues trying to shut them down after losing children to them. When Kubitz points out the house cannot accommodate the number of children they have, Charlie opts to find a new permanent facility somewhere in the city for the daycare rather than remove a few of the kids to keep it operating.
Marvin quickly mentions he knows of a building with potential, but they cannot afford it. They decide to hold a fundraising children's festival called "Rock for Daddy Day Care", to raise the necessary capital. However, Harridan learns of the event and sabotages it with help from her hesitant assistant Jennifer. At the same time, Jim offers Charlie and Phil their old jobs back at double their salaries, letting them run the whole health division. Harridan offers to take in their children for a cheaper price in exchange for Daddy Day Care shutting down. Charlie and Phil reluctantly accept the offer, leaving Marvin heartbroken and refusing to join them. The next day, at the marketing meeting for a cereal made from cotton candy, Charlie questions his decision, after he realizes the impact Daddy Day Care has had on Ben and the other children, and swiftly quits, leaving Jim and his executives dismayed.
Convincing Phil to quit and re-open Daddy Day Care, and informing Marvin of their plans, Charlie confronts Harridan during a student orientation with the daycare's children, and reveals to the parents in attendance how little she cares about their children. Realising how much Daddy Day Care changed and helped their children, the parents let them go back to Daddy Day Care. Six months later, the daycare manages to buy the building it needs to expand, and prospers, with Charlie and Phil successful, Jennifer now working for the center, and Marvin entering a relationship with one of the children's mothers. With Chapman forced out of business, Harridan is forced to work as a crossing guard, and inadvertently causes a traffic jam when a flower she receives from one of her former children, Crispin, causes her to be swarmed by bees, wasps, & hornets.
