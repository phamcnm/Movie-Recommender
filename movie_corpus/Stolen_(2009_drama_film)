Stolen is a 2009 American mystery film directed by Anders Anderson and starring Josh Lucas, Jon Hamm and Rhona Mitra.


== Plot ==
Tom Adkins is a policeman from Barnstable, California working to uncover the truth behind two crimes; the disappearance of his son eight years earlier, and a fifty-year-old homicide of another boy.  In the opening scenes, a mummified corpse is unearthed at a construction site.  At first the policeman fears the body is that of his son, but also welcomes closure to the search. However, pathology demonstrates that these are the remains from a much older crime. The film continues with parallel stories in flashback, showing the events leading to the crimes and the investigation. The body is found with a burned toy, identical to one his own son had at the time of his disappearance, along with a whistle engraved with the words, "Keep the home fries burning". 
After noticing the similarities in the two cases, Adkins attempts to re-interrogate a local prisoner named Rogianni, a convicted murderer who the detective suspected in his son's disappearance. However, Adkins is rebuffed by the prison warden, due to earlier interrogations in which Adkins became violent. The investigation leads him to a man who lived in 1958 named Matthew Wakefield and his mentally disabled son, John. The striking similarities in the cases push Adkins’ obsession over the top. Barely holding onto his sanity and bound by redemption, Adkins unravels the unspeakable truth behind what happened to his son.
