Adventures in Wild California is a documentary film showcasing the scenery and extreme sports found in California. It is narrated by Jimmy Smits and was released to IMAX theaters in 2000. The film is directed by Greg MacGillivray.
California's geography and culture, which the film asserts inspires people to take chances, is the focus of the documentary. Extreme sports such as sky diving and surfing are captured with dramatic aerial and underwater photography, while examples such as Walt Disney's creation of an entertainment empire based on a "little mouse", the construction of the Golden Gate bridge during the Great Depression, and the establishment of high-tech Silicon Valley, showcase the risk-taking California inspires.
